    "   - **Dictionary**: A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Instead of using positions, data in a dictionary is stored with keys, and each key maps to a corresponding value. Keys can be of various data types (e.g., strings, numbers), and they are used to uniquely identify and access values.\n",

    "   - **List**: Elements in a list are accessed using integer indices. To access an element in a list, you use its position within the list.\n",
